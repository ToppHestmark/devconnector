# Dev Connector

[Demo app](https://dev-connector-vs-555.herokuapp.com/)

> Social network for developers

Full-stack project with NodeJS, ExpressJS, MongoDB and ReactJS. This projects is just a showcase me learning how to build a full-stack application with NodeJS and use of database. The instructor for this course are Brad Traversy - Udemy. User have access to view the public profiles and read all the comments. To ba able to leave a comment or like a post user have to create a user account with username and password. From there users will be able to add credentials to the profile and start using the app.

User interface for this app is simple since I was more focusing on the NodeJS and integrating Redux in to the react app.
